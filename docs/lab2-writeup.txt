HeapFile Iterator Implementation:
The HeapFile Iterator was designed to provide a flexible way to traverse through all values in a HeapFile. 
Key design decisions include:

- Supporting iteration from the beginning of the file or from a specific ValueId
- Lazy loading of pages to minimize memory usage
- Handling cases where pages might be empty or unreadable

Insert Value Function: 
The insert_value function required careful consideration of how to efficiently store and manage values across pages. 
The implementation follows these key design principles:

Space Efficiency:
- First attempt to find space in existing pages before creating a new page
- Iterates through existing pages to find the first page with available slot
- Avoids unnecessary page creation

Page Management:
- Uses heapfile.num_pages() to determine the current number of pages
- Creates a new page only when no existing pages have space
- Assigns new pages incrementally (starting from page 0)

Value Size Validation:
- Includes a panic for values larger than page size to prevent impossible insertions
- Ensures data integrity by checking value size before insertion

Time Spent:

- Total Time: Approximately 15 hours
- Complexity primarily arose from understanding Rust's ownership and borrowing concepts
- Debugging also took around 5 hours

Liked: Implementing the storage manager’s functions, especially insert_value, and handling page offsets for efficient data storage.
Disliked: Debugging in Rust proved challenging, as I’m still getting comfortable with its memory model. Print statements were helpful but time-intensive for tracking down specific issues.
